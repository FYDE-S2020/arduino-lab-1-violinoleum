/* Demonstrates outputting a message recieved with Serial with SPI on ESP32 
 * Type a short (<100 char) message in the serial monitor and observe the output on the logic analyzer.
 * Many MCUs, including the ESP32 and TM4C, have SPI implemented in hardware as a peripheral.
 * At the lowest level, you are writing bytes to special SPI registers. Arduino abstracts this away.
 * SPI is a synchronous communcation protocol, meaning it requires a clock signal. 
 * Clock speeds are determined by your parts - check their data sheets. 
 * There are four pins used for SPI: 
 * MOSI: Master out Slave in. We will be outputting the message on this line.
 * MISO: Master in Slave Out. Since we don't have peripherals, this is unconnected. You may ignore it.
 * SCLK: Clock signal. We will use 1MHz. You can try experimenting with other speeds and profiling them.
 * CS or SS: Chip Select, aka Slave Select. This tells the ESP32 or the Slave that they should be listening. It is active LOW. 
 * Arduino doesn't handle CS for you, it must be set before and after sending the message.
